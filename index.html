                         <p>Lemons are a popular fruit that people use in small quantities to
                             add flavor to food. However, they rarely consume
                              them alone due to their intense, sour taste. Lemons
                               give flavor to baked goods, sauces, salad dressings,
                                marinades, drinks, and desserts, and they are also
                             a good source of vitamin C</p>
